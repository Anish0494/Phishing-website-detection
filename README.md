# Phishing-website-detection 
 The data is used to train the model for detecting phishing website 
#####    The project is divided into 4 parts:
    
    1) pre-processing of the data-set
    2) train the random forest, SVM and decision Tree Regression by dividing the data-set into training 
       and testing
    3) train the random forest, SVM and decision Tree Regression by dividing the data-set into training 
       and testing after applying PCA
    4) The data-set is divided into K bucket using kfold and then the 2nd step is performed
    
#### NOTE:
	The accuracy score of the 4th one is calculated by doing the average of the each set of training and
	testing
